# Node.js packager for Windows Azure

This tool is an open-source implementation of the packager for
Windows Azure, and runs, contrary to the proprietary original, also
on non Windows operating systems.

The purpose of the library is to create .cspkg files that can be dispatched
to Windows Azure.

Use it in conjunction with [Azure Management SDK for node](https://github.com/c9/azure-management-sdk-for-node)
to deploy the package file to Azure.
